# In this program we could use some functionality that we would use in image processing such as : 
### 1. Grayscale
### 2. Brigthness
### 3. Zoom in and Zoom out Image
### 4. Image Cropping
### 5. Histogram and Histeq
### 6. Blur  and Sharping Image
### 7. Edge Detection
### 8. Base Treshold and Seed Region Growth
### 9. Erosion and Dilation
### 10. Lossless Image

The program and its design are not good enough, I'm trying hard to update as soon as possible 
All the code are not using library just a simple clean code
